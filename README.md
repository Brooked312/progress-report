Short answers to the following questions are good enough. If you would like to change your project plan and obtain approval for the change, please email your section leader directly.

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We created a nice and aesthetically pleasing background design. We have created some obstacles and placed them in different scripts to increase the difficulty. We made checkpoints that allow the players to save their progress as well.  

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We need to finish the other levels. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
Some of the scripts were giving us problems, and the checkpoints were not saving properly at first.
